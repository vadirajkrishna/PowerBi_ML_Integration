# PowerBi_ML_Integration
Using python code in Power Query for Data analysis and model building

## Python code

The file 'split_and_tag_data.py' is used to split the dataset into 80% train and 20% test data. <br>
The file 'Model_building_on_split_data.py' is used to train a linear regression model on the data. <br><br>
<i>Note: Idea here is to integrate Python in the Power Query for that I have picked Linear regression</i>

## Dataset

The data set used is from Kaggle can be found [here].(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance/).
